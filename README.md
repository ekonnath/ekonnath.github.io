# Introduction
This repository was created to store my final project submission for the course "Creative Coding" at Vrije University in Amsterdam during the summer of 2023. The guidelines required we take an existing abstract piece of art and recreate it using [p5.js](https://p5js.org/); adding animation and interactivity to a previously static piece of art. 

Instead of combing the web for art found in museums and galleries, I went to my Spotify with the idea an album's artwork could be paired with its music to create an immersive sound and visual experience. The cover art for Childish Gambino's _Kauai_ EP struck out for its simplicity and potential.
